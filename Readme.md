# Xml view properties
### barColor
It is a color field which represents signal bar color. 
Default color is set to white

### barCount
This integer property determines total signal bar count. Default signal bar count is 5

### signalLevel
It is an interger number which represents signal strength in percentage. It's range is between 0-100.

### showAllBar
It is a boolean property. It is used to toggle visibility of signal bars. Default value is true<br>
Example : Suppose we have 5 signal bars. Now for 60% signal 3 bars should be displayed.
Now if this property is set to true then all 5 bars will be displayed. 
But among the 5 bars, 3 bars will be filled with color and the rest 2 bar will
only have border.
